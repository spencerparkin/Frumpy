# Frumpy

Frumpy is a software-based renderer that doesn't need a GPU.  Of course, this also means it's
relatively slow, but it's still a fun exercise in computer graphics programming.  Note that it
is up to the host application to provide some way of getting the pixels to the screen.  Frumpy
only concerns itself with generating the pixel data.  Following is the latest screenshot.

As you can see, it can render texture-mapped meshes and do real-time shadows.
